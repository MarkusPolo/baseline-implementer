- Sometimes the job will fail, because the Switch was sleeping. I need to add 3 "returns" and some waiting time to the beginning of the template.
- Editing a template is not possible

- Live Console should have a option for live key translation. User could say: Backspace is now CTRL+H by pressing the button or button combination for input. y -> z for english keyboards etc.
- Live Console should have a Option to Copy a Output to clipboard. You should be able to input a command, the worker sends it and copys the output to your clipboard. For example: show run, worker sends commands, records output (with pagination detection and sending of space to switch), copys output to clipboard.
