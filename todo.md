# What is working:
Template Builder is really nice

# What I want to add:
- The Logs say: Verification Passed, but I cant really verify, that the worker really verified the changes made. So i want to add more debug output to the logs:
  1. The Logs show the exact verification that was done.
  2. The worker should capture the full output of the verification process (running config) and the user should be able to see it. (Not in the Logs, but in the UI(extendable))
