- Sometimes the job will fail, because the Switch was sleeping. I need to add 3 "returns" and some waiting time to the beginning of the template.

- Verify Username/Password input on switches that need that. Password verification is really slow on a lot of devices, so worker needs to wait until it is finished and input prompt appears.

- CSV?
