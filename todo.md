- Sometimes the job will fail, because the Switch was sleeping. I need to add 3 "returns" and some waiting time to the beginning of the template.
- Editing a template is not possible
- When alot of people are using the application, there will be alot of templates. I need a way to have it more organized.
- Some switches do not accept backspaces. I know Cisco Switches sometimes need CTRL+H to delete a character. I'm thinking of adding a Backspace Translator to the Live Console UI -> User could create "translations" or "Hotkey like" on his own. He could say: Backspace is now CTRL+H (UI is asking the user to press the button or button combination for input)
- Live console should have a button to extract something from the console output and copy to clipboard. Like you could say "i want the show run" and it will print the command and copy the output to clipboard (with pagination detection and sending spaces to counter pagination)
- Check if pagination is really working like it should
