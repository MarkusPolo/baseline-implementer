# What is working:
- Working, really stable Live Console
- Creation of Macro without errors

# What is not working:
- auto redact secrets button
- auto suggest variables button
- the user doesn't know how to set variables
- there needs to be a feedback for what variables have been recognized (like in the normal template builder)
- Rename "Macro" to "Template" to be consistent with the rest of the application.

# What is not working (high priority):
- When I save the macro, it's nowhere to be found. I cant use this "macro". I'd like to have it exactly like the Templates that i have right now. So the same format (i think jinja2 but please verify) and the same location (in the same folder as the templates, and the same place in the frontend).
- When creating a job and selection the ports that will get the template, you can enter the variables. Just like the normal Templates now.
