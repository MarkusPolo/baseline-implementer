- Sometimes the job will fail, because the Switch was sleeping. I need to add 3 "returns" and some waiting time to the beginning of the template.
- When alot of people are using the application, there will be alot of templates. I need a way to have it more organized. And you should be able to search for templates. And you should be able to sort them by name, date, etc. And you should be able to delete templates.
