- Sometimes the job will fail, because the Switch was sleeping. I need to add 3 "returns" and some waiting time to the beginning of the template.
- Editing a template is not possible
- When alot of people are using the application, there will be alot of templates. I need a way to have it more organized.
- Some switches do not accept backspaces. I know Cisco Switches sometimes need CTRL+H to delete a character. I'm thinking of adding a Backspace Translator to the Live Console UI -> User could create "translations" or "Hotkey like" on his own. He could say: Backspace is now CTRL+H (UI is asking the user to press the button or button combination for input)
- Live Console should have tabs for different sessions with different ports
- Live console should have a different UI for selecting the Port. It should autodetect if something is plugged in at that port and if somebody is already using it. If not, it should show a button to connect to it.
